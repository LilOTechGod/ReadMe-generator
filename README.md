# ReadMe-generator

## Description

After another challenging week of continous learning. I came across node which allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. I found this quite difficult due to the fact that I was tranitioning into ES6. In order to fully understand this concept, I challenged myself by creating a read me generator using the integrated terminal. Not only will this provide more hands on experience which is the best way I learn but, it combines everything I've learned in the past 2 weeks into one project. Every day I encounter a setback but with perseverance and motivation I over come and fascinate myself with what else can I learn!

## Installation

There are a couple steps you first must install in order to make the generator work.

1. Have a text editor installed on your machine.
2. Pick a file inside of parent folder and open in integrated terminal.
3. Enter, "npm init-y" inside terminal.
4. Next in terminal enter "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" to install the latest version of inquirer.
5. Finally to check if you followed these steps correctly, you should see three files created which are node_modules, package-lock.json, and package.json.

## Usage

Here's a quick demonstration of how to use the ReadMe generator. Hope you enjoy it!
